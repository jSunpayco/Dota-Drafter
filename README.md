# DOTA Drafter

Note: This is a personal project in progress. Currently, a live demo is deployed on Stackblitz, but will soon be migrated to a different platform in order to accomodate for a backend component. Readme will be updated soon.

This is a web application developed to simulate Captains Mode, a set of rules in the video game DOTA 2. The feature replicated from the game is when two team leaders take turns picking and banning one character from a list of 100+ within a specified time limit.

The frontend is written in ReactJS, whereas MantineUI was also used for some html components.
